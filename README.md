# Bors

> "One rabbit stew coming right up!"

Bors is a wrapper for the Vowpal Wabbit library by John Langford. It consists of a wrapper around the command line making it easy to interface to it via Ruby.

NO QUITE FINSHED YET. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

## Using the library

## Contributing to bors
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
